Here's the stats in the game. These stats apply to the player character and all enemies.

## Energy
Energy is the stat that is consumed for any entity to perform an action
such as making an attack or moving to a new tile.

By default, each entity will gain 100 energy / 5 game ticks.Once the entity has reached the default attack & move cost of 100 energy, that entity can take a turn. If the entity gains more than 100 energy / 5 ticks, they will perform actions faster than other entities. Likewise having less than 100 energy / 5 ticks will cause entities to perform actions slower than other entities.

## Vision
Vision is the stat that determines how many tiles away that an entity can perceive. Entities will make decisions based on what's in their line of sight.

## Health
This determines how much damage an entity can take before it's destroyed

## Strength
An entity's strength stat is defaulted to a value of 10. Any value less than 10 will start to have negative impacts, while values above 10 will have positive impacts. The strength stat will affect the following:

* Damage - Every +2 strength over 10 will add +1 to damage rolls. Every -2 strength under 10 will subtract 1 from damage rolls.
