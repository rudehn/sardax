# Fire System
Fire can be created by multiple sources, such as weapon attacks.
Fire will show up on the map and will burn for 4 turns. Any entity that steps
on the fire will get the burning status effect. This effect lasts for 7 turns and
will inflict 1-3 damage per turn. Stepping on fire while burning will reset the burning
duration.
